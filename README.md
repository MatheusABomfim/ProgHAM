The ProgHAM repository contains the implementation of a trained Gradient Boosting machine learning model designed to predict people living with HTLV (PLwHTLV) with a indicative of development HAM/TSP (HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis). The model was developed using a clinical dataset of 121 PLwHTLV, followed up at the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital (HUOC) (Pernambuco - Brazil), employing undersampling via Tomek Links to address data imbalance.

The goal of ProgHAM is to provide a predictive model that supports medical follow-up for patients, enabling better risk stratification for the progression of HAM/TSP.

ðŸ–¼ Project Overview
To better illustrate ProgHAM's performance, the following image provides an overview of its performance (It is worth emphasising that the tool requires validation for clinical use and should be used as a support tool for clinical staff, NOT AS A DIAGNOSIS DEVICE):

Contributing to the improvement of ProgHAM The active participation of all users in improving ProgHAM is essential for the advancement of knowledge and health practices related to HTLV. By making data available to be trained with ProgHAM, you help improve the accuracy of the device's predictions, directly contributing to the early identification of patients who need specialised follow-up.

Every piece of data entered, every analysis carried out and every piece of feedback shared enriches the system, allowing it to become ever more robust and reliable. Your involvement not only helps ProgHAM evolve, but also strengthens the support network for individuals with HTLV, generating concrete results for public health. Together, we can continue to transform the future of medicine, making ProgHAM an increasingly accurate, efficient and accessible tool for everyone.

Well, now that you have an overview of our project, if you're interested, your contribution will be of great value in enhancing the model, improving both the training and classification processes.
