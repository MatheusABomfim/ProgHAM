Description:
The ProgHAM repository contains the implementation of a trained Gradient Boosting machine learning model designed to predict the risk of people living with HTLV (PLwHTLV) developing HAM/TSP (HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis).The model was developed using a clinical dataset of 121 PLwHTLV, employing undersampling via Tomek Links to address data imbalance.

The goal of ProgHAM is to provide a predictive model that supports medical follow-up for patients, enabling better risk stratification for the progression of Tropical Spastic Paraparesis/HTLV-Associated Myelopathy (TSP/HAM).
