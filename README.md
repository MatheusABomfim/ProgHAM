ProgHAM
Description:
The ProgHAM repository contains the implementation of a Gradient Boosting machine learning model trained to predict the prognosis of People Living with HTLV (PLwHTLV). The model was developed using a clinical dataset of 121 PLwHTLV, employing undersampling via Tomek Links to address data imbalance.

The goal of ProgHAM is to provide a predictive model that supports medical follow-up for patients, enabling better risk stratification for the progression of Tropical Spastic Paraparesis/HTLV-Associated Myelopathy (TSP/HAM).

üî¨ Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and balancing using Tomek Links.
Model Training: Implementation of Gradient Boosting for clinical prognosis prediction.
Results Interpretation: Analysis of the importance of clinical features in forecasting TSP/HAM progression.
Reproducibility: Modular code and notebooks to facilitate pipeline execution.
üìÅ Model Development
The ProgHAM_model_development folder contains all the steps for model development, including:

Data preprocessing and feature selection
Model training and hyperparameter tuning
Performance evaluation and validation
Interpretability analysis
